**Nami** is a modular and lightweight anarchy client base built for PVE and automation.  

Most popular Minecraft clients are closed-source, paid, and obfuscated, making them difficult to audit or trust. Some may include backdoors or malicious code.

This project started as a clean, open-source alternative aiming to be transparent, secure, and easy to extend without relying on unsafe third-party clients.
